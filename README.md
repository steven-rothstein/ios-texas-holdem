# iOS Texas Hold'em

This repository holds source files for a simple iOS app to play Texas Hold'em without betting any real money.

The idea of this app was to provide a fun, safe environment to play the game, free from the risk of throwing money away.

The app was written in pure Swift. All facets of the game itself were coded from scratch without any supplementary libraries. That includes the card shuffle logic, how to determine which hands were winners, the playing card object types themselves, etc.

The betting behavior is where this implementation left off. As such, there are two demo videos in the root of this repository:

- [Demo - Prototype - No Betting.m4v](https://github.com/steven-rothstein/ios-texas-holdem/blob/master/Demo%20-%20Prototype%20-%20No%20Betting.m4v)

- [Demo - Prototype - With Betting.m4v](https://github.com/steven-rothstein/ios-texas-holdem/blob/master/Demo%20-%20Prototype%20-%20With%20Betting.m4v)
